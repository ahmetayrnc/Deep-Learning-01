# Deep-Learning-01

The goal of this assignment is to build a model that can recognize handwritten characters. We are given a set of images that we can to use to develop the model. The task is the following: Given a query image xq and a support set of images {xi},i âˆˆ [0..4]. Find which images in the support set correspond to the character given in the query image. The train data is organized in sets of query and support set images. The characters that the model is trained on are different from the characters in the testing dataset and any future data that the model will be used on. In other words, the model needs to learn to recognize and match images that it has not seen before.
